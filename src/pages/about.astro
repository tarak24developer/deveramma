          <p>
            Deveramma Temple has a rich history dating back to the early 12th century. The temple was established 
            as a tribute to Goddess Deveramma, a powerful manifestation of divine feminine energy. According to 
            local legends, the temple site was chosen after the deity appeared in the dreams of a local ruler, 
            instructing him to build her abode at this specific location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the centuries, the temple has withstood various historical events, including natural calamities 
            and invasions, yet has remained a symbol of resilience and spiritual strength. The temple has been 
            renovated and expanded multiple times while preserving its original architectural elements and spiritual significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through generations, Deveramma Temple has been a center for religious practices, cultural events, and 
            community gatherings. The traditions carefully preserved by successive temple authorities have ensured 
            that the authentic rituals and ceremonies continue to be performed with the same devotion and precision.
