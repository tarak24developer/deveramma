          <p>
            Deveramma Temple has a rich history dating back to the early 1900s. The temple was initially considered as 
            Meruga Venkateswara Rao Garu's <strong>Thaataku Illu</strong>. Later, the Mantada villagers and members of the Meruga family arranged a <strong>Penukutillu</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 2000s, Meruga Venkata Subbaiah Garu's grandson, Meruga Rajesh Garu, on May 15, 2006, built a temple building with his own money 
            as an act of devotion and <strong>bhakthi</strong> towards Deveramma. Since then, renovations and upgrades have been made.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the temple was built, it became a significant place of worship for the Meruga family. From then on, a priest has been 
            appointed to perform daily rituals and special <strong>poojas</strong>. Every Friday, an <strong>abhishekam</strong> is performed for the deity, and 
            <strong>paala pongalu</strong> is offered, which is considered very auspicious. Once every three years, a grand festival is celebrated 
            with special <strong>poojas</strong> and rituals, known as <strong>Sambaraalu</strong>.
          </p>
