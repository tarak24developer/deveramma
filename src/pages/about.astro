          <p>
            Devaramma Temple has a rich history dating back to the early 1900s. The temple was initially considered as 
            Meruga Venkateswara Rao Garu's <strong>Thaataku Illu</strong>. Later, the Mantada villagers and members of the Meruga family arranged a <strong>Penukutillu</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 2000s, Meruga Venkata Subbaiah Garu's grandson, Meruga Rajesh Garu, on August 29, 2007, built a temple building with his own money 
            as an act of devotion and <strong>bhakthi</strong> towards Devaramma. Since then, renovations and upgrades have been made.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the temple was built, it became a significant place of worship for the Meruga family. From then on, a priest has been 
            appointed to perform daily rituals and special <strong>poojas</strong>. Every Friday, an <strong>abhishekam</strong> is performed for the deity, and 
            <strong>paala pongalu</strong> is offered, which is considered very auspicious. Once every three years, a grand festival is celebrated 
            with special <strong>poojas</strong> and rituals, known as <strong>Sambaraalu</strong>.
          </p>

            Devaramma – the divine Kalpavalli who fulfills the sincere wishes of countless devotees. She is the compassionate Mother who has blessed many childless couples with children. Devaramma is worshipped with deep devotion by the Meruga family and the people of the surrounding villages.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the occasion of marriages, housewarming ceremonies, and other sacred events, devotees make it a point to visit and seek the blessings of the Goddess.
          </p>          <p>
            Those who were unmarried, those who were longing for children, and those facing hardships – after offering their heartfelt prayers to the Goddess – were blessed with successful marriages, children, and employment through Her divine grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students too, by the blessings of the Mother, achieved good marks and succeeded in their education. All forms of suffering and difficulties were removed by Her compassion.
